Depth & Complexity
Randomizer

Application that uses Icons created by J Taylor Education for grades k-12. Makes kids think more in depth about questions/problems.
This app helps teachers easily create 3 sentences at random (or they can manually change what they want) for all 3 learning levels. They can then save what they have as a PDF and use for meetings, handouts, etc.
